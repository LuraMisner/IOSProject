# Doggy Playdate

### Deliverable 1
###### 23 October 2021

In this deliverable we set up a simple app structure with a map view and a view showing a list of contacts a user would see in the app. Everything is hard-coded mock data right now, but in the `backend` branch we have also almost fully implemented a Firebase database system that will pull data from the cloud.
